# First flutter project

Hello I am Mujtaba Hussain and this is my first flutter project, or rather a single flutter window/page, which contains some widget, I used something called [StatefulWidget](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/StatefulWidget-class.html) which is used when you want your widget to change it's state during the time program is running.

It contains basic widget and some buttons. The buttons are interactive so we can use this to change the value of `proficiency`.
