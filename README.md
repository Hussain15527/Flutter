# Developer ID

This is a simple app that displays basic information about a developer and their current short term goal and their current proficiency in it.

This uses something called [StatefulWidget](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/StatefulWidget-class.html) which is used when you want your widget to change it's state during the time program is running. since your proficiency is ought to increase with time, `Statefulwidget` is prefered over `statelessWidget`.

It also contains basic widget and some buttons. The buttons are interactive so we can use this to change the value of `proficiency`.
